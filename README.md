# Picniq
This application is a dynamic platform, designed to provide the nearest parks and restaurants based on the users’ location.

## Deployed Application
```
https://jpbrickhouse.github.io/Picniq/
```

## Motivation

During the COVID-19 pandemic, locally-owned restaurants and bars have been forced to rethink their entire operation. While they are unable to provide the same indoor dining experiences, they are still operating via delivery and takeout. Our Picniq app opens up a new world of dining opportunities: local food delivered directly to neighborhood parks, creating a unique, socially-distant dining experience.

## Features
The Picniq allows for two forms of location input: current location (based on the user’s browser) or input address (based on any desired location). The search results are provided by FourSquare and are based on proximity, ensuring that only the nearest restaurants and parks are provided to the user. Within the results for each restaurant, a link is provided to connect the users to a delivery service.
